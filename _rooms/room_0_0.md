At the very heart of the dungeon, is the Chamber of Echoes.

As you enter, the air feels thick with anticipation. The walls are adorned with ancient runes that shimmer faintly in the dim light. In the center of the room stands a large stone pedestal, upon which rests a beautifully crafted silver mirror. The mirror reflects not only your image but also faint whispers that seem to emanate from the walls, creating an eerie atmosphere.

<!-- The Whispers: The whispers can be heard if players listen closely. They are soft and can be difficult to decipher, but they hint at the correct sequence. For example, you might hear, "Flame... Water... Earth..." -->

<b>The Whispering Runes</b>

There are four sets of runes on the walls, each representing a different element: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. Each set has three runes, each inscribed with a word related to its element (e.g., Fire: Flame, Ember, Ash).

When you speak a word aloud while looking into the mirror, the mirror will reflect a faint glow if the word is part of the correct sequence. If the word is incorrect, the mirror remains dark.

<!-- 
Solution:
To solve the puzzle, players must:
Listen carefully to the whispers and identify the correct sequence of words.
Stand before the mirror and say the words in the order they believe is correct.
If they say the correct sequence, the mirror will shine brightly, and the door will unlock, allowing them to proceed. If they are incorrect, they will hear a low rumble, and the whispers will become more chaotic, indicating they need to try again.
Hints: -->

<!-- Players can find a scroll in the room that provides a cryptic clue about the elements, such as "The flame dances in the rain, the earth holds the ashes, and the wind carries the whispers."
If players struggle, they can spend time observing the runes, which may provide additional context or hints about the relationships between the elements.
Conclusion:
Once the correct sequence is spoken, the door creaks open, revealing the next part of the dungeon, while the mirror's surface ripples and reveals a hidden message or treasure within its depths. -->
